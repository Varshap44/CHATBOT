# CHATBOT
This project demonstrates a custom chatbot that leverages Hugging Face's GPT-Neo model for generating responses. The chatbot is built using LangChain for structured language model management and Gradio for a user-friendly interface.

The chatbot handles user queries, generates context-aware responses, and provides an interactive experience through a Gradio UI. It also integrates asynchronous operations for faster response generation and smoother user interaction.

## Key Features:
- **GPT-Neo Model**: Uses Hugging Face's GPT-Neo model to generate responses.
- **LangChain Integration**: Manages query handling and context-aware response generation.
- **Gradio Interface**: A simple and interactive UI for real-time chatbot interaction.
- **Asynchronous Query Handling**: Improves response time and UI performance.
